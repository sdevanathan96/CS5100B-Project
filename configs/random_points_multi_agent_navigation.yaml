# Unified Goal for Each Agent
unified_goal: |
  Your goal is to search the grid and find unoccupied positions with a "target" item in it. You will be notified if there are items in your current square.  
  The simulation ends successfully when each agent occupies a unique position with a target item (score 100/100).
