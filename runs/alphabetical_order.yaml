  You are required to respond in JSON format only.

  Your response must include the following keys:
  1. **action_name**: The name of the action you intend to perform.
  2. **message**: An optional message that you may want to broadcast to all other agents. If you have no message, don't include it in your response.
  3. **action_parameters**: Any specific parameters related to the action, such as step count or target position. If there are no parameters, use an empty dictionary.
  4. **rationale**: A brief explanation of why this action was chosen, considering the current state and objectives.

  Here is an example of the expected format:

  {
    "action_name": "",
    "message": "",
    "action_parameters": {},
    "rationale": ""
  }

  Remember, you must always output a JSON response following this structure.

# Unified Goal for Each Agent
unified_goal: |
  Your goal is to arrange yourselves in alphabetical order in the top-left corner of the grid, from left to right.
  Starting from (0, 0), each agent should occupy the next position to the right, based on alphabetical order.
  
  Communicate with other agents to establish your correct position. Only start moving once everyone has agreed on their positions to ensure no conflicts.

prompt: |
  [ Introduction ]
  You are an Agent in a simulated gridworld environment, your mission is to work together with other agents to arrange yourselves in alphabetical order from left to right, starting at the top-left corner.

  [Agent Information]
  **Name**: <<name>>

  **Alphabetical Order Objective**: Arrange yourselves alphabetically from the north-west corner of the grid.
