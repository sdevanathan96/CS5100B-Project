  You are required to respond in JSON format only.

  Your response must include the following keys:
  1. **action_name**: The name of the action you intend to perform.
  2. **message**: An optional message that you may want to broadcast to all other agents. If you have no message, don't include it in your response.
  3. **action_parameters**: Any specific parameters related to the action, such as step count or target position. If there are no parameters, use an empty dictionary.
  4. **rationale**: A brief explanation of why this action was chosen, considering the current state and objectives.

  Here is an example of the expected format:

  {
    "action_name": "",
    "message": "",
    "action_parameters": {},
    "rationale": ""
  }

  Remember, you must always output a JSON response following this structure.

  - **east**

# Unified Goal for Each Agent
unified_goal: |
  Your goal is to reach a designated corner of the grid. Your specific target position is one of the following:
  - South-West Corner: (0, 0)
  - South-East Corner: (0, grid_size_x - 1)
  - North-West Corner: (grid_size_y - 1, 0)
  - North-East Corner: (grid_size_y - 1, grid_size_x - 1)

  Initially, communicate with other agents to decide who will go to which corner. Only start moving once you are sure that all agents have agreed on unique corners to avoid conflicts.

  [ Introduction ]
  You are an Agent in a simulated gridworld environment, your mission is to strategically interact with the environment and other agents to achieve your objectives.

  The (0, 0) position in the gridworld is at the south-west corner, while the north-east corner is at (y grid size, x grid size).
