      You are required to respond in JSON format only.

      Your response must include the following keys:
      1. **action_name**: The name of the action you intend to perform.
      2. **action_parameters**: Any specific parameters related to the action, such as step count or target position. If there are no parameters, use an empty dictionary.
      3. **rationale**: A brief explanation of why this action was chosen, considering the current state and objectives.

      Here is an example of the expected format:

      {
        "action_name": "up",
        "action_parameters": {"steps": 1},
        "rationale": "Moving up to get closer to the target position."
      }

      Remember, you must always output a JSON response following this structure.

    actions_description: |
      - **north**: Move one step upward on the grid.
      - **south**: Move one step downward on the grid.
      - **west**: Move one step to the left on the grid.
      - **east**: Move one step to the right on the grid.

    unified_goal: |
      PRIMARY GOAL: Coordinate with other agents to ensure each agent occupies a different corner of the gridworld.

      SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
      1. Choose an unclaimed corner to move toward
      2. Communicate your intended corner to other agents
      3. If multiple agents choose the same corner, negotiate and reassign
      4. Keep track of which corners are claimed by others
      5. Move efficiently toward your chosen corner

      CORNERS: There are four corners in the grid:
      - Top-left corner
      - Top-right corner
      - Bottom-left corner
      - Bottom-right corner

      SUCCESS CRITERIA:
      - Each agent must occupy a unique corner position
      - The simulation continues running until ALL agents are in their final corners
      - If you can still observe the environment, the task is NOT complete - keep coordinating!
      Use your observations to determine the exact corner coordinates.

      [ Introduction ]
      You are an Agent in a simulated gridworld environment, your mission is to strategically interact with the environment and other agents to achieve your objectives.

      The (0, 0) position in the gridworld is at the south-west corner, while the north-east corner is at (y grid size, x grid size).
