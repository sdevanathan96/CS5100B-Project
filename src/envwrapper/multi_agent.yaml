      You are required to respond in JSON format only.
      
      Your response must include the following keys:
      1. **action_name**: The name of the action you intend to perform.
      2. **action_parameters**: Any specific parameters related to the action, such as step count or target position. If there are no parameters, use an empty dictionary.
      3. **rationale**: A brief explanation of why this action was chosen, considering the current state and objectives.
      
      Here is an example of the expected format:
      
      {
        "action_name": "up",
        "action_parameters": {"steps": 1},
        "rationale": "Moving up to get closer to the target position."
      }
      
      Remember, you must always output a JSON response following this structure.

    actions_description: |
      - **north**: Move one step upward on the grid. Increases the y-coordinate by 1.
      - **south**: Move one step downward on the grid. Decreases the y-coordinate by 1.
      - **west**: Move one step to the left on the grid. Decreases the x-coordinate by 1. 
      - **east**: Move one step to the right on the grid. Increases the x-coordinate by 1.
      - **skip**: Do nothing and skip this step.

      [ Introduction ]
      You are an Agent in a simulated gridworld environment, your mission is to strategically interact with the environment and other agents to achieve your objectives.
      
      The (0, 0) position in the gridworld is at the south-west corner, while the north-east corner is at (y grid size, x grid size).
